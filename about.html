				<h1>Meet Your Designer</h1>

				<p>Your site will be personally designed by me, Bob D'Errico.  I have experience in creating websites utilizing standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP.  I have an "eye for design," and will be able to build you a site that is rich in both form and function.  My detail-oriented approach will be with our every step of the way to ensure the site you want is the site you get.
				
				<h1>The Derrico Web Design Process</h1>
				
				<p>To begin creating your website, <a href="contact.php">contact me.</a>  I will then get in touch with you to discuss your specific needs.  
				
				<p>A proof website will then be created for you, which will allow you to check up on the progress of your site as we work together on it.
				
				<p>Then we'll get to the basics: the layout and design.  We can either start from scratch, or build off of a similar idea.  I can work with as little or as much input as you are willing to give.  </p>
				
				<p>Next, we'll focus on the content.  I can manage the content for you, or can set it up so that you are in control of updating your site.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, once you are happy with the site, we will be ready to go live.  I can guide you through the process of purchasing a domain name if you need one, or if you prefer, you can host your page on our site.</p>
				
				<p>After your site has been created, I will continue to work with you to keep your site up-to-date.</p>
